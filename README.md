# Prime Player for Google Play Music

### Description

This is the repository for the Chrome extension for Google Play Music.
It is based on ideas of the extension "Better Music For Google Music".

Features include:

* last.fm integration (now playing, scrobbling, like/unlike)
* a powerful miniplayer with different layouts and color schemes
* toast notifications
* support for thumbs and 5-star ratings
* and more

### Notes for contributers

If you find any bugs or would like to see new features, please file an issue here on GitHub or - even better - send a pull request.
Please use the "develop" branch for contributing, as I use [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
(I know, that's pushing it a bit, but I try to learn sth. on developing this).

If you need to change the CSS for the popup/miniplayer/toast, you'll need [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
You can use the script watch-sass.sh for convenience then.
